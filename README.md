Architecture
•	Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA). 
Working on this project helps my development still working with stack development. The project included Express HTML, JavaScript and SPA. In Express and JavaScript, it uses controllers to help with request sent from the browser. The JavaScript enhances responsiveness that allows for real-time updates. The SPA reduces loading times and by all only updating necessary components.

•	Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?
The backend uses a NoSQL MongoDB database to provide a reliable ability to handle large volumes of unstructured data that can be scaled and query faster

Functionality
•	How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?
Json is different from Javascript by the format, which can be used in different programming languages.  Since Javascript is primary used for create dynamic content on the web, Json is used to define objects. In the project the use of APIs, RESTful APIs and Json provide coverage for both backend and frontend. The use of JSON allowing it to receive requests and send responses.

•	Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.
An example of improving functionality through refactoring code is using handlebars. The uses of handlebar template allow for the structure page to be reused when changing display. This allows for a quicker update process.  


Testing
•	Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.
The method of requesting retrieval various types of API testing and endpoints are used such as HTTP method of GET, POST, PUT and DELET. The GET is used to retrieve data, while POST creates new entries. This is how it communicates with the server by using HTTP. The API testing increases when layer of security is applied such has authentication that were used in Postman.


Reflection
•	How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?

This course has helped me understand Full stack development. When I first began this course my understanding of Full stack development was little. Understanding both front-end and back-end technologies helps me with essential skills such as HTML, Json, JavaScript, and much more. I have developed ab understanding of database management and API. These skills will be essential to my professional development and goal of finding a career that is suitable for me.
